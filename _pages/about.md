After 10 years of professional poker, I started to learn python and data science as a hobby, this hobby has turned into a passion which I wish to turn into a career. I am excited to explore all aspects and applications of data science and machine learning.

This blog will be made up of a variety of content, much of which will be purely for my own personal reference. There will be short reports, longer project work and data science competition entries. I will also post any research I do as I continue to fill in the gaps in my machine learning, data science, mathematics or programming knowledge.
