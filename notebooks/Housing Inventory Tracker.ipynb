    "# Housing Inventory Tracker - A PyBites code challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "I have recently stumbled across the twitter tag #100daysOfCode, the idea being to code or do some supplementary learning towards coding for 100 days in a row. I am 7 days in and am already finding myself thinking about code and problems I could solve much more regularly throughout my daily life.\n",
    "\n",
    "Todays challenge was taken from [PyBites Code Challenges](https://pybit.es/pages/challenges.html), a blog hosting free, open ended tasks released periodically to complete in your own time and then share with the community. This is task 8, a good year behind the most current challenge but I hope to catch up during my 100 days of code. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge is simple with some added options if you wish to take it a few steps further. The instructions from PyBites:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### House Inventory Tracker Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a list of rooms (doesn't have to use the list type).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each room in your rooms list needs to contain at least 5 items (ie, TV, couch, table, etc) and the relative dollar value of each item.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The script you will write will print out each room along with the individual items and values. This needs to be properly formatted, eg: no printing a dict as is.\n",
    "\n",
    "There were also some bonus parts to the challenge:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### These are bonus features. Not required but cool to try if you're interested:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create some sort of program shell with a menu system around this. ie, \"Which room would you like to list out?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you're really game, allow users to create rooms and update information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You could even make an API with Flask or your preferred framework\n",
    "\n",
    "- Print the total dollar value of each room and the entire house.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Have persistent storage of the data. sqlite3 = stdlib and light-weight, but feel free to use your preferred DB / module.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are clearly many ways in which to approach this challenge, simply entering the information in a script in the form of lists or a dataframe would allow the results to be printed to the screen. However having had little practice creating classes I opted to model the house as a class instance, allowing for the whole process to be easily user controlled after the script has been run, first creating the house, then adding rooms and items.
